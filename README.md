# Instagram UnFollowers-Detector

Given the information you can download from Instagram, this program detects the unfollowers you follow.
Accesing your instagram data requires the following steps (they can be done from Mobile or Web):

Instagram > More > Your Activity > Download Your Information > HTML or JSON (the program supports both) > Send

After receiving the zip file via mail, be sure to extract all files, and copy all files from "followers_and_following", and paste them in the same folder as the "main.py" file

Note 1: In the last step before send, if you download your info from iOS Mobile, it doesn't require for you to choose the format and by default sends it as HTML (as far as I know).

Note 2: The file where the followers are stored might be named "followers_1". You must change its name to "followers"
