# UnFollowers-Detector

Given the information you can download from Instagram, this program detects the unfollowers you follow.

Accesing your instagram data requires the following steps (they can be done from Instagram Web):

Instagram > More > Your Activity > Download Your Information > JSON File > Send

Note: The last step is vital for the program, as the information must be a in a JSON format, not HTML (the other option). At least in iOS, you can't choose and it sends it by default in HTML, and that's the reason doing it from a Web Browser seems like the only valid option for choosing the format in which you want your information.
